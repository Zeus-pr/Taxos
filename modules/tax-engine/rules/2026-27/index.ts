/**
 * TaxOS — Versioned tax rules for Tax Year 2026-27 (AY 2027-28).

 * TAX RULE SOURCE POLICY (§14): rules here are transcribed from official
 * Income Tax Department sources. Every rule carries a RuleMeta with

 * Draft → Review → Source-verified → Tests → Approved → Publish workflow (§50).
 * Historical rule sets are never overwritten — create rules/<next-year>/ instead.

 * Primary sources (verified 2026-09-29):
